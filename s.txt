i missed it when it was brought up in chat, but i think i should explain at least my position on that soros thing, cause it kinda bugs me, and i think it might help to see "the other sides" point, but i dont want to bring it back up in general channel 'cause of the no politics rules, gotta stick to my own rule :P

but basically, i dont think dunking on soros should be considered a "far right" thing tbh, cause when you lay it all out, he's a european billionaire thats using his vast wealth to influence politics across the world, that's the heart of the problem, that's a verifiable fact, and realistically, the left wing *should* be opposed to that too, and i think the modern left weakens its own position when it gives him a free pass from any an all criticism because he's jewish, "fuck all billionaires; except the jewish ones" is a REALLY weird position to most people, being jewish shouldnt give you immunity from criticism

like sure, if someone *is* using it to target jews, that's a different story, but honestly, 90% of people aren't, i dont think it's fair for blanket all criticisms of him under the same label as the fringe weirdos

anyway that's all rant over
